# ðŸ’µ DollarDollar Bill Y'all

A sleek, easy-to-use expense tracker and bill-splitting app built with Flask, designed for local and privacy-focused expense management.

## Development Journey: Leveraging AI Assistance ðŸ¤–

### AI-Powered Development Process

This project represents a unique approach to software development, combining:
- Local Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Claude (Anthropic's AI)
- Human creativity and domain expertise

#### AI Collaboration Approach
- Used local LLMs and Claude for:
  * Refining code structure
  * Providing best practices
  * Helping with complex logic implementations
  * Assisting in documentation
- Maintained human oversight and critical decision-making

**Key AI Interaction Strategies**:
- Prompt engineering for precise code generation
- Iterative refinement of AI-generated suggestions
- Using AI as a collaborative tool, not a replacement for human insight

## Project Philosophy ðŸŒ±

This is part of a personal mission to create open-source, locally-hosted alternatives to proprietary services. DollarDollar is the first of three planned projects aimed at providing self-hosted, privacy-respecting tools that can be run entirely on personal infrastructure.

### Motivation
- Explore AI-assisted development workflows
- Move away from restrictive platforms like Splitwise
- Provide full control over personal financial data
- Create transparent, open-source solutions
- Enable local hosting and complete user ownership

## What is this?

DollarDollar helps you track expenses, split bills with friends or roommates, and manage shared costs through customizable groups. It's particularly useful for:

- Roommates sharing household expenses
- Friends splitting vacation costs
- Couples managing shared finances
- Families tracking group expenses
- Groups organizing events with shared costs

## AI Development Insights

### Lessons Learned
- Local LLMs are powerful for initial code generation
- Claude excels at providing complex code but Human context and domain knowledge remain crucial.
- AI tools are most effective when used collaboratively. But it did reduce my deployment time .

### Challenges Overcome
- Translating AI suggestions into coherent architecture
- Ensuring code quality and best practices
- Maintaining a clear vision while using AI assistance

## Key Features ðŸš€

- **Expense Tracking**: Log expenses with detailed information
- **Flexible Splitting**: Split costs equally, by percentage, or custom amounts
- **Group Management**: Create groups for organizing shared expenses
- **Monthly Summaries**: View spending breakdowns by month
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Track which cards were used for purchases
- **User Management**: Admin controls for managing users
- **Local Hosting**: Complete control over your financial data
- **Open Source**: Transparent and community-driven development


## AI and Open Source

This project is a testament to the potential of AI-assisted open-source development. By combining local LLMs, Claude, and human creativity, we're exploring new paradigms of software creation that emphasize collaboration, transparency, and innovation.

### Future AI Integration Goals
- More sophisticated AI-assisted code generation
- Improved prompt engineering techniques
- Exploring ethical AI development practices
